# Twitch Authenticator

## Twitch OAuth and Eventsub Client

In the [twitch module](./src/twitch/) you can find a raw implementation of the applications credentials oauth flow and the eventsub websocket service that do not depend on any external libraries.

The [app](./src/app.py) is the main entrypoint for the twitch related logic

## AMQP and RabbitMQ

Since I will use the notifications elsewhere and I am using RabbitMQ at work (although in Go) I have also implemented a Rabbit sink and consumer (the latter mainly used to testh the former) to subscribe and receive the eventsub notifications from outside.

You can find those in the [rabbit examples](./examples/rabbit/)
